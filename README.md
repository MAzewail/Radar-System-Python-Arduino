# Radar-System-Python-Arduino
Welcome to the Radar System project repository! This project combines Python, Arduino, and an ultrasonic sensor to create a radar-like system that detects and displays the presence of objects in its vicinity. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and use it.
